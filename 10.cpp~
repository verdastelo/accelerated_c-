    The increment expression in a for lopp need not always alter the loop control variable by a fixed amount. Instead, the loop control variable can change in any artibrary way. Using this concept, write a program that uses a for loop to generate and display the progression 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on. */
