/*
    In C++, strings are stored as arrays. There are two major 
    conventions on how the strings are represented in memory. 
    NULL-terminated string is one of them. In this representation,
    the last element of a string is always zero or NULL. 
    
    A string's last element is not swapped with NULL. C++ appends
    zero to strings, so that a string with 10 elements is 11 elements
    long.
