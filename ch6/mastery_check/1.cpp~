/*
    What are the two ways that an argument can be passed to a
    subroutine? 
*/

The two ways an argument cam be passed to a subroutine are: 

1. Call-by-value
2. Call-by-reference

In C++, although call-by-value is the default mode of operation, it is possible to change it by declaring reference paramters.
