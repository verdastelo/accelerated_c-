/*
    In C++, what is a reference? How is a reference parameter
    created? 
*/



    A reference is like a pointer, with one big difference: 
    you cannot reassign a reference to a new variable once 
    it has been set.
    
    This is how you declare references: int f (int &x) // By using
    an ampersand (&) before a variable's name.
